# <a href="https://freepeerX.vercel.app/" target="_blank">FreePeerX ü§ì</a>
<div>

<p><em>`Direct Driver-to-Passenger Connection ‚Ä¢ No Middleman ‚Ä¢ Lower Fees ‚Ä¢ Faster Service`</em></p>

</div>FreePeerX is a revolutionary peer-to-peer meter taxi application that connects drivers and passengers directly without intermediaries. By leveraging WebRTC technology through PeerJS, FreePeerX eliminates the need for central servers to handle ride matching and fare calculation, resulting in lower fees and a more efficient service.

3. **Pair with Driver**:

1. Enter the 6-digit code provided by the driver
2. Click "Verify & Start Ride"



4. **During the Ride**:

1. Monitor your route on the map
2. Watch the fare calculation in real-time
3. Click "End Ride" when you reach your destination



5. **After the Ride**:

1. Review the fare breakdown
2. Share ride details if desired
3. Start a new ride or exit the application





### For Drivers

## üèó Architecture

FreePeerX is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct classes:

### Core Components

1. **P2PCommunicationManager**: Handles all peer-to-peer communication using PeerJS
2. **DriverRegistration**: Manages driver information and online status
3. **LocationTracker**: Tracks and records user location using the Geolocation API
4. **FareCalculator**: Calculates ride fares based on distance and time
5. **CodeManager**: Generates and verifies unique codes for ride pairing
6. **DriversManager**: Manages driver discovery and selection
7. **MapManager**: Handles map initialization, markers, and routes


### Data Flow


## üîÑ P2P Communication

FreePeerX uses WebRTC (via PeerJS) for direct peer-to-peer communication between drivers and passengers:

### How It Works

1. **Peer Creation**: Each user creates a unique peer ID when they join the network
2. **Discovery**: Drivers register with a discovery service (simulated in this demo)
3. **Connection**: Passengers connect directly to drivers using their peer IDs
4. **Data Exchange**: Location updates and ride requests are sent directly between peers
5. **Fallback**: If P2P connection fails, the app falls back to simulated drivers


### Security Features

- Unique 6-digit codes for ride verification
- Code expiration after 5 minutes
- Secure WebRTC data channels with encryption


## üë®‚Äçüíª Setting Up for Development

### Project Structure

```plaintext
freepeerx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js          # Main JavaScript file with all functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/             # Images and other assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:

1. Make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. Refresh your browser to see changes



2. **Testing P2P Functionality**:

1. Open two browser windows to simulate a driver and passenger
2. Register as a driver in one window
3. Connect as a passenger in the other window



3. **Simulated Mode**:

1. Set `CONFIG.p2p.enabled = false` in app.js to use simulated drivers
2. This is useful for testing without a second device





## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request


### Code Style Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow the existing modular pattern
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test P2P functionality thoroughly


## Call
  If you're interested in contributing to the project, please feel free to reach out. I'm looking for collaborators who are passionate about P2P technology and want to help build a better ride-hailing experience as well the P2P communication. Whether you're a developer, designer, or just someone with great ideas, your input is welcome!


## Note
  This project is a proof of concept and is not intended for production use. It highlights the potential of P2P technology in the ride-hailing industry. The app is fully built using V0. I just added some features and modified the code a little bit. While the full P2P communication is still in progress (no worries, the app works with simulated drivers for now), so I continue working on and refining this functionality. The app is fully functional and can be used to demonstrate the concept of P2P ride-hailing.
