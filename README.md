### FreePeerX - P2P Meter Taxi Web Application 
# FreePeerX ü§ì
<div>

`<p>``<em>`Direct Driver-to-Passenger Connection ‚Ä¢ No Middleman ‚Ä¢ Lower Fees ‚Ä¢ Faster Service`</em>``</p>`

</div>FreePeerX is a revolutionary peer-to-peer meter taxi application that connects drivers and passengers directly without intermediaries. By leveraging WebRTC technology through PeerJS, FreePeerX eliminates the need for central servers to handle ride matching and fare calculation, resulting in lower fees and a more efficient service.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Passengers

1. **Start a Ride**:

1. Click "Get Started" on the landing page
2. Select "Passenger"
3. Note your unique code (you can share this with a specific driver if desired)
4. Click "Find a Driver"



2. **Select a Driver**:

1. Browse available drivers on the map
2. Click on a driver card to select them
3. For real P2P drivers, a ride request will be sent automatically
4. For simulated drivers, you'll proceed directly to the pairing screen



3. **Pair with Driver**:

1. Enter the 6-digit code provided by the driver
2. Click "Verify & Start Ride"



4. **During the Ride**:

1. Monitor your route on the map
2. Watch the fare calculation in real-time
3. Click "End Ride" when you reach your destination



5. **After the Ride**:

1. Review the fare breakdown
2. Share ride details if desired
3. Start a new ride or exit the application





### For Drivers

1. **Register as a Driver**:

1. Click "Get Started" on the landing page
2. Select "Driver"
3. Fill in your details in the registration form
4. Check "Remember Me" if you want to save your information
5. Click "Register"



2. **Manage Your Availability**:

1. Use the "Online/Offline" toggle to control your availability
2. When online, your location will be broadcast to nearby passengers



3. **Accept Ride Requests**:

1. Ride requests will appear in your dashboard
2. Review passenger details and distance
3. Accept or decline the request
4. If accepted, note the generated code to share with the passenger



4. **During the Ride**:

2. Your earnings will be updated in your dashboard





## üèó Architecture

FreePeerX is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct classes:

### Core Components

1. **P2PCommunicationManager**: Handles all peer-to-peer communication using PeerJS
2. **DriverRegistration**: Manages driver information and online status
3. **LocationTracker**: Tracks and records user location using the Geolocation API
4. **FareCalculator**: Calculates ride fares based on distance and time
5. **CodeManager**: Generates and verifies unique codes for ride pairing
6. **DriversManager**: Manages driver discovery and selection
7. **MapManager**: Handles map initialization, markers, and routes

## üîÑ P2P Communication

FreePeerX uses WebRTC (via PeerJS) for direct peer-to-peer communication between drivers and passengers:

### How It Works

1. **Peer Creation**: Each user creates a unique peer ID when they join the network
2. **Discovery**: Drivers register with a discovery service (simulated in this demo)
3. **Connection**: Passengers connect directly to drivers using their peer IDs
4. **Data Exchange**: Location updates and ride requests are sent directly between peers
5. **Fallback**: If P2P connection fails, the app falls back to simulated drivers


### Security Features

- Unique 6-digit codes for ride verification
- Code expiration after 5 minutes
- Secure WebRTC data channels with encryption


## üë®‚Äçüíª Setting Up for Development

### Project Structure

```plaintext
freepeerx/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js          # Main JavaScript file with all functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/             # Images and other assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:

1. Make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. Refresh your browser to see changes



2. **Testing P2P Functionality**:

1. Open two browser windows to simulate a driver and passenger
2. Register as a driver in one window
3. Connect as a passenger in the other window



3. **Simulated Mode**:

1. Set `CONFIG.p2p.enabled = false` in app.js to use simulated drivers
2. This is useful for testing without a second device
